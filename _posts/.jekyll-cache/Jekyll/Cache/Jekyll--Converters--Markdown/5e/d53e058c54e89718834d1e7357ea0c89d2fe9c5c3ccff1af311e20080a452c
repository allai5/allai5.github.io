<p>The cyclic coordinate descent IK algorithm was quite interesting. Iâ€™m guessing
the optimization procedure implicitly encodes the Jacobian(s), but it was
definitely very cool to see how you could have an IK algorithm without ever
having to explicitly define the Jacobians, especially for applications where you
have very little information. Hereâ€™s a cool paper on using cyclic coordinate
descent for protein loop closure: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12717019/">paper link</a>.</p>

<p>The Cartoon Animation filter . I wonder if weâ€™ll be able to easily translate
from motion capture data do motion data stylized for all sorts of different applications.</p>

<p>Most of this lecture was familiar material for me, as Iâ€™ve previously taken
<a href="http://cmuanimation.weebly.com/">60-125: Introduction to 3D Animation</a>.
Nonetheless, it was nice to see the main types of 3D animation techniques
(Keyframe, Procedural, Physics-based, Motion Capture) formally presented, since
until now Iâ€™ve just learned about them through conversation.</p>

<p>Motion VAEs (MVAE), or <em>autoregressive conditional variational autoencoders</em>,
were new to me however. <strong>Autoencoders</strong> are neural networks that leverage
unsupervised learning in order to efficiently represent some set of input data.
In particular, they output a singular value for each state attribute.
<strong>Variational autoencoders</strong> are autoencoders that describe a probability
distribution, rather than a value, for each state attribute.</p>

<p>I wonder if theyâ€™re similar to Model-Predictive Controllers? Will update this
post when I figure that out.
Itâ€™s awesome to see that this class touches upon so many different fields. This
past weekend Iâ€™ve been brushing up on the basics of fluid dynamics, since my
final paper presentation is on <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/papers/Ando2020/Ando2020.pdf">A Practical Octree Liquid Simulator With Adaptive
Surface Resolution</a>.
Looking forward to an amazing semester!</p>
